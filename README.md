## About the Book
Developing real-time apps is the need of the hour, and apps that deal with humongous amounts of user data and real-time information that needs to be updated frequently are in high demand. Currently, one of the most popular frameworks for this task is Ionic Framework, which is undergoing a major makeover.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<ion-tabs>
<ion-tab [root]="tab1Root" tabTitle="One" 
tabIcon="water"></ion-tab>
<ion-tab [root]="tab2Root" tabTitle="Two" 
tabIcon="leaf"></ion-tab>
<ion-tab [root]="tab3Root" tabTitle="Three"
